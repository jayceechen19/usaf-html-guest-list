<!--
  * se Create React App to create an application that a user would use to track the guest list for their upcoming event
* Each guest should be a component
* There should be a component that renders all guests
* There should be, on the UI somewhere, the total numbers of guests who have RSVPd and the number of guests whose RSVP you are still waiting for
* Only guests that have RSVPd should render under "Guest List"
* The list should be an alphabetical list (by last name) of each guest's' full name
* The user should be able to add new guests from the UI (without interacting with code)
* The user should be able to update the rsvp status of a guest (without interacting with code)
